# From-Nand-To-Tetris
Online course given by The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem

This project contains my implementation of the projects in the [first part of this course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) and the certificate I took from Coursera after finishing it .


Projects:

Project1- Boolean Logic : This project engages you in the construction of a typical set elementary gates using HDL.

Project2- Boolean Arithmetic : Using the chipsets of previous project you will build a group of adders and use them to build an ALU that will be used in next projects in the course.

Project3- Sequential Logic : This project takes you to the world of memories , where you will build the main memory unit (RAM) . Starting from a flip-flop to a one-bit register to n-bit register to a family of RAM chips.

Project4- Machine Language : Assuming that the HACK computer and the machine language have been built, you will write some low-level programs using the HACK assembly language and use the supplied emulator to excute the program.

Project5- Computer Architecture : You will assemble all the parts you have built in the previous projects to get the general purpose 16-bit computer called HACK. You start by building the CPU, integrate it with the RAM and get the computer ready for excuting programs written in HACK assembly language.

Project6- Assembler : In this project you are givin the choice of translating a HACK code to binary code by hand or by writing a program to do it for you . I chose to write a program to do it and chose Java to write it .


PS : I included the parts I wrote in the projects and not the files I have sumbitted to the course . I recommend you to try with the projects yourself because the course is meant to teach by doing .
